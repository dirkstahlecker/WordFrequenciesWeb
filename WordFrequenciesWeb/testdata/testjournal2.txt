1-21-12: Mr. Nelson test Mrs. Margulieux another word


9-20-11: Since I sit next to McKenzie in English, I wanted to mention something about YoungLife last night, start some sort of conversation. It was really annoying that I never could bring myself to do it. I don't know how to make opportunities myself, and can't take advantage of those that present themselves, which is really annoying.
I hung out with Kailyn, Hammer, Donald, and Dani during lunch. it was a lot of fun, at one point Donald managed to hit himself in the nose while trying to eat an apple, it was incredibly funny.
Fourth hour was great, I talked with Lane, Christianna, and Megan as usual. As we were leaving, Christianna asked me a couple questions about robotics, and I was able to talk to her for a little bit, which was nice. She's thinking about applying for robotics, hopefully she does.
In government, we were told yesterday that we needed to "mark our territory" and stake out a desk to sit in the rest of the tri. I sat in my same place, next to Donald and behind Hammer. McKenzie actually came in and sat right in front of Donald. I was able to talk to her for a little bit, and I actually went up and talked to her after class by asking her which hour newspaper was. We talked for most of the length of the hallway, all the way down to the Yearbook room. She asked me to write an article for the Snakeskin, the same one Michaela had talked to me about earlier. That's neat, it should be fun writing it! Overall, I need to figure out what's going on in my mind involving girls. I don't even quite know how I feel, other than frustrated.
